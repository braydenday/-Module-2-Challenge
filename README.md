# <BraydenDay-Module-2-Challenge>

## Description

I wanted a website optimized for recruiters and future clientele to be able to check out my work and who I am. This will help build credibility and give me better recognition alongside my resume. I learned how to code a whole website from creating the index.html/style.css pages to finalizing this ReadMe, how to flex wrap selectors in css, modifying colors/margins/fonts/etc, how to add in trademarks and other special characters, formating HTML and CSS in a logical order, how to redirect to a URL link from an image, and how to deploy the website live!
